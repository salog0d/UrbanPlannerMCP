# 🌆 UrbanPlannerMCP

**UrbanPlannerMCP** is an intelligent **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that powers urban analytics by integrating **governmental** and **NASA datasets**.
It enables distributed AI agents to analyze infrastructure, population inequality, and demographic indicators through FastMCP tools and standardized schema definitions.

---

##  Overview

UrbanPlannerMCP provides an **MCP-compliant service layer** for urban planning analysis.
It exposes modular analytical tools that can be streamed or called programmatically by orchestrators, allowing you to evaluate city infrastructure, demographic distributions, and social inequalities.

This server serves as the **analytical engine** for the broader *Urban Planner AI* ecosystem, connecting models, schemas, and prompt templates in a consistent and reusable manner.

---

##  Features

* **MCP Server Integration** – Built on [`fastmcp`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/fastmcp) for stateless and streaming tool execution.
* **Tool Modularization** – Tools like `CityInfraModel` and `PopulationInequalitiesModel` expose well-defined analytical functions.
* **Structured Schemas** – Type-safe Pydantic schemas for population and inequality data.
* **Prompt Templates** – Custom prompt builders for LLM-based urban analysis and comparison tasks.
* **Configuration Layer** – Centralized `Settings` class for environment variables and API integration.
* **Extensible Architecture** – Ready to integrate new tools and models (e.g., for housing, emissions, or mobility).

##  Core Modules

### `core/settings.py`

Centralizes all configuration and environment variable management, including:

* API keys (Google Maps, NASA datasets, etc.)
* Database URLs
* Model host settings (`mcp_host`)

### `prompts/_prompts.py`

Contains reusable **prompt templates** for:

* Urban zone comparison
* Infrastructure pattern summarization

### `schemas/`

Defines input/output structures for MCP tools:

* `PopulationRequest`, `PopulationResponse`
* `UnequalityIndicatorsRequest`, `UnequalityIndicatorsResponse`

### `tools/`

Each file defines an **MCP tool** via `@mcp.tool` decorator:

* `city_infra_model.py`: Evaluates infrastructure coverage and accessibility.
* `population_inequalities_model.py`: Computes inequality metrics across regions.

### `tools/server.py`

Main entrypoint for running the **FastMCP server**.

##  Example Tools

### City Infrastructure Model

```python
@mcp.tool(
    name="City Infrastructure Model",
    description="Analyzes urban infrastructure distribution and service availability using demographic and spatial indicators.",
)
def run_city_infra_model(request: PopulationRequest) -> PopulationResponse:
    """Analyzes infrastructure density, accessibility, and service coverage across city zones."""
    return ...
```

### Population Inequality Model

```python
@mcp.tool(
    name="Population Inequality Model",
    description="Evaluates socioeconomic and spatial inequalities in population data using government and NASA datasets.",
)
def run_population_inequalities_model(
    request: UnequalityIndicatorsRequest,
) -> UnequalityIndicatorsResponse:
    """Calculates inequality metrics such as employment, education, and health access disparities."""
    return ...
```
